STEPS TO FOLLOW: <br/>
* Open the secret.zip file in Wireshark and examine the packet capture of satellite communication. <br/>
* By going through the intercepted data to identify commands exchanged between the satellite and ground station weâ€™ll be able to identify an encoded message. <br/>
* Then decode that message to extract the original message, revealing the flag. <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT:. <br/>
* We will understand how satellite and ground station interactions are represented in network traffic. <br/>
* And also how to reverse these interactions to retrieve readable data. <br/>
